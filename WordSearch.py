# Given a 2D board and a word, find if the word exists in the grid.
# The word can be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cell, where "adjacent" cells are those horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used more than once.

# 1. DFS. When we search, we should avoid visiting back
# Time: O(mn*4^k) where k is the length of the string; mn for for loop and for the dfs method its 4^k.Since the dfs method goes only as deep as the word length we have T(k)=4(T(k-1))=4*4T(k-2)=....=.. which will be 4^k.
